<P align=justify>Last Saturday was Children's Day at the local zoo, and Kerry 
and four other children were up bright and early so that they could be at the 
beginning of the line (each child has a different favorite type of animal that 
he or she was anxious to see). As they waited on line, each child received a 
complimentary Mylar balloon with a different design on it. Two of the children - 
Johan and Mario - are boys, and three - Kerry, Lani, and Naomi - are girls. From 
the information provided, determine the order (first, second, third, fourth, or 
fifth) in which each child stood in line, each child's favorite type of animal 
(one child likes the chimpanzees), and the design (one is a rainbow) on the 
balloon each received. </P>
<OL>
  <LI>The girl whose favorite animals are the tigers (who isn't Naomi) was third 
  in line. Her balloon was neither the one with hearts nor the one with stripes. 

  <LI>Johan (who was not the fifth one in line) was standing immediately behind 
  a boy. Lani's favorite animals are neither the tigers nor the zebras. 
  <LI>Neither Lani's nor Naomi's balloon was either the one with hearts or the 
  one with stripes. The balloon with stripes wasn't Mario's. 
  <LI>The one whose favorite animals are the zebras, who isn't the one who 
  received the balloon with swirls, was fourth in line. The one who received the 
  balloon with polka dots likes the lions the most. Johan isn't the one whose 
  favorite animals are the giraffes. </LI></OL><BR></DIV>
